## Installation

These are two different applications,
one for the navigation the other for the reading module

For the Object detection, after importing give the command "Open Object Detection" to the application.

## What it does
Once the app is opened user can tell whether they want to access the object detection or the optical character recognition module. In the object detection module, the user is told if there is an object in front of them and what kind of object it is and it will help the person for indoor and outdoor navigation. Similarly in the optical character recognition module, people would be able to read the text.
