Android Vision API Samples
==========================

The Mobile Vision API is now a part of [ML Kit][3]. We strongly encourage you to try it out, as it comes with new capabilities like on-device image labeling! Also, note that we ultimately plan to wind down the Mobile Vision API, with all new on-device ML capabilities released via ML Kit. Check out [this codelab][4] to use the vision APIs in ML Kit.

This sample has been deprecated/archived meaning it's read-only and it's no longer actively maintained (more details on archiving can be found [here][1]).

For other related samples, check out the new [github.com/android/user-interface-samples][2] repo. Thank you!
